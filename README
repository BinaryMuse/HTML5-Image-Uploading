== HTML5 Image Uploading

This project is an experiment in image uploading options using Rails 3 and HTML5 features. Specifically, I'm trying to get multiple file uploads working without the aid of Flash-based tools such as SWFUpload. 

== Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

2. Run bundle install, rake db:create and rake db:migrate to install the gems and build your database (there's only 1 table) 

3. Start the server with rails s and go to http://localhost:3000/ (the root route is mapped to "images#index")

4. You should see options for uploading using the file input (with "multiple" attribute) and a drag-and-drop box (not working quite yet)

5. It's a fairly stock Paperclip setup, so images should be saved to public/system/attachments

== TODO

1. Get Drag-and-Drop working better 

2. Use jQuery
